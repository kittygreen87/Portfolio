    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h3>Front-end developer from North Carolina, USA</h3>
    <div class="about-me-paragraphs"> 
        <p>We are currently living in North Carolina. 
            <br>
            We have lived here for 3 years. 
            <br> 
            We live here because my husband is in the military. 
            <br>
            We will move to Wyoming when he gets out.
        </p>
            
        <p> We have a rescue mutt named Elmo. 
            <br>
            He was adopted in March of 2019. 
            <br>
            He is very cute and loves to eat carrots.
