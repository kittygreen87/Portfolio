        <p>We are currently living in North Carolina. 
            <br>
            We have lived here for 3 years. 
            <br> 
            <br>
            <br>
            We live here because my husband is in the military. 
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            We will move to Wyoming when he gets out.
